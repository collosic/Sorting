I implemented mergesort based on the concept from a course on coursera.  Mergesort takes in a pointer to the first element in an array of integers and the size of the array.  It will then return a pointer to the first element in a 
sorted array.  **Note the function returns the exact same pointer that was passed to it initially.  Also, the original array that was passed into mergesort will also be the sorted array in ascending order.
